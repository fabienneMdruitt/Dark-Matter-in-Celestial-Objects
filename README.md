Hello,

This repository was created to give the reader more information on the code generated for the Monte Carlo simulation as part of my LVL4 Physics project.

The folders in the "documentation read" include all the papers that were either used during the project or that could provide a better insight into the subject of Monte Carlo simulations for modelling Dark Matter distributions in celestial bodies.

The "Python code" folder contains all the code created during this project that is relevant to the final Monte Carlo simulation. This file does not include any of the preliminary and intermediary material produced to get a better understanding of the project and to test the methods used. The code created to generate all graphs and table values is found within the respective Python files for the functionality. The location of these pieces of code is highlighted by a "PLOTTING" keyword.

The "Monte Carlo datasets" folder contains several key datasets created and saved in CSV files by the Monte Carlo simulation for different parameters.

Thank you for reading!
